## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-format support**: Export and import annotations in COCO JSON, CSV, VGG JSON, VOC XML, and YOLO TXT formats.
- **AI-Assisted Labeling**: Use built-in AI models like `tensorflow/tfjs@2.0.1` and `tensorflow-models/coco-ssd@2.1.0` to automatically detect objects in images.
- **Manual Annotation**: Draw rectangle and polygon boundaries for precise object detection.
- **Upload/Download**: Seamlessly upload and download datasets.
- **Easy Label Correction**: Manually adjust incorrect labels after AI detection.
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Keep workflows running smoothly with efficient dataset management.
